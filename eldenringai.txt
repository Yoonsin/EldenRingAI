The EldenRingAI project started on September 27th, 2022.
The goal for the project is to create a reinforcement learning algorithm capable of killing the Tree Sentinel with the ultimate hopes to beat other bosses as well.
The EldenRingAI code has several components, a Flask server to interact with Elden Ring, a OpenAI gym environment, and a reward generator.
The Flask server works by using pynput to press keys on the keyboard and uses Protron for running Elden Ring on Linux.
The actions the bot can take are: press w and release s, press s and release w, press a and release d, press d and release a, release wasd, press space, attack, strong attack, block, parry, use flask, hold space, and jump.
The OpenAI gym environment has two main functions step and reset, the environment step function works by grabbing a screenshot of the game, generating a reward based on the frame, pressing keys, and resetting on death, the environment reset function is being called on death and checks for a frozen loading screen and initalize the fight with the Tree Sentinel.
The reward generator works by taking in a screenshot of the game and parses out two main peices of information player and boss HP.
To get player or boss HP the screenshot is cropped down to just the area of the respective HP bar and then does a hue/saturation/value (HSV) filter on it producing an image where the white pixels correspond to the red of the HP bar and the black pixels correspond to the empty space of the HP bar.
The model is trained using stable_baselines3, specifically PPO with a CnnPolicy.
